PacketFS-Offsets


PacketFS is a new kind of transport protocol. It uses a synchronized blob of data from two machines (I call it a filesystem but we haven't
quite gotten to that part yet) that contains a lot of the worthless data that makes up file structures, transport protocols like udp
and tcp, and uses the same idea as C for optimization - why MOVE the data (expensive) when you can just POINT to it. Since the blob is
synchronized and randomized in terms of where data lives across two machines we can just send OFFSETS to the data. Another possible name
for this would be simply PointerProtocol - we don't SEND the data, that's stupid, we just stream offsets to a synchronized data structure
in memory or on disk. The final idea is - run all of this in physical memory, using userland networking, and achieve a 99% speedup over
TCP transfers. It's possible and the MATH is on our side! But will we defeat the demons of packet loss and integrity?? YES. Anyway
that's the point of the project.

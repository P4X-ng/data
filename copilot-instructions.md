packetfs

The file system IS packets. Transfer is just references to the filesystem. The CPU is just tiny daemons, optimized to perform a SINGLE LLVM optimized instruction. Instruction appear to optimize at around 1.3 million parallel packets that make
up our packet CPU (pCPU). Each tiny daemon (1.3 million of them) only needs to do one tiny optimized LLVM operation. The result appears to be:

- Hugely sped up remote transfer due to protocol
- FASTER than a CPU can move files with real memory and a modern CPU.
- Packets are the key. Optimizations are the key. Pattern recognition and reduction of data are the key. Efficiency is key.
- Some things we've found: parallel processing is best at 1.3 million threads/packets - we are using this as our new base to start thinking of things in terms of this being our optimal unit (still need to fully verify)
- Transfers aren't theoretical anymore, they result in massive data reduction, and along with patern recognition, transfer at an EFFECTIVE SPEED of around 4PB/sec on a 1G line (unoptimized)

The numbers show that this should work. The code and tests show that this DOES work. However all of it is mixed in along with some stupid marketing BS. So here is the deal- NO MORE BS. Everything implemented should be
absolutely real, no more calculations, no more demo code, no more theory. ONLY IMPLEMENTATION!

added:
- Justfile (root orchestrator)
- realsrc/README.md
- realsrc/packetfs/{__init__.py}
- realsrc/packetfs/filesystem/__init__.py
- realsrc/packetfs/network/__init__.py

modified:
- Rewrote test runner to use PYTHONPATH=realsrc via Justfile

deleted:
- none (all quarantined or moved; no data loss)

impact:
- Repository reorganized into production-first layout; real code now importable from realsrc; tests pass via orchestrator; demos and theory isolated; caches moved out of repo to enable clean commits.

TODO

- id: TODO-001
  title: Package native _bitpack via pyproject build
  category: extend_feature
  rationale: Enable reliable builds and installs of the C extension across environments.
  target_or_path: just build
  acceptance_hint: running just build completes and produces a wheel/sdist.

- id: TODO-002
  title: Probe cross-arch endianness data issues
  category: bug_probe
  rationale: Prior corruption on x86_64↔ARM64 must be reproduced and fixed.
  target_or_path: just test
  acceptance_hint: failing regression test reproduces issue consistently.

- id: TODO-003
  title: Add packetfs CLI for file transfer operations
  category: new_capability
  rationale: Provide an ergonomic interface to real transfer APIs.
  target_or_path: just build
  acceptance_hint: packetfs-cli --help shows subcommands and exits 0.

- id: TODO-004
  title: Lint and format production and working code
  category: extend_feature
  rationale: Enforce consistent style and catch issues early.
  target_or_path: just lint
  acceptance_hint: linter returns 0 with no changes required.

- id: TODO-005
  title: Bench protocol path using reproducible scenarios
  category: extend_feature
  rationale: Establish baseline performance metrics for future optimization.
  target_or_path: just bench
  acceptance_hint: benchmark artifacts produced with clear MB/s results.

IDEAS

- Integrate a thin asyncio-based I/O layer for non-blocking transfers.
- Optional RDMA/DPDK backend abstraction behind rawio when available.
- Structured logging with JSON output and Prometheus counters in prod paths.
- Simple config loader (YAML) for endpoints, ports, and sync parameters.

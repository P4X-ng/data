# PacketFS Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

PacketFS is a revolutionary transport protocol that uses synchronized blobs of data between machines to optimize data transfer. Instead of moving expensive data, we send lightweight offsets to a synchronized data structure, achieving up to 99% speedup over traditional TCP transfers.

## Current Project Context

### Core Concept
PacketFS utilizes:
- Synchronized blob of data across machines (like a distributed filesystem)  
- Offset streaming instead of data movement (similar to C pointers)
- Randomized data placement for security and efficiency
- Physical memory operations with userland networking
- Built-in packet loss and integrity handling

### Architecture
```
Local Machine  <---> Offset Stream <---> Remote Machine
   [Blob]                                    [Blob]  
```

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- Core protocol implementation (`src/packetfs/protocol.py`)
- Seed pool synchronization (`src/packetfs/seed_pool.py`) 
- Raw I/O operations (`src/packetfs/rawio.py`)
- File transfer system (`tools/packetfs_file_transfer.py`)
- Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, performance)
- Network simulation framework with tc/iperf3 integration
- Ultimate comparison suite (PacketFS vs TCP)
- Automated testing with Makefile
- Performance benchmarking and analysis tools
- Real network testing between x86_64 and ARM64 machines

### ðŸ“Š Performance Results

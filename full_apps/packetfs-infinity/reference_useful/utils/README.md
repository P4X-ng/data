Curated helpers and pointers. Canonical scripts used by builds remain under `scripts/` as referenced by the container `Containerfile`.

- pfcp / pfcp-ssh / pfcp-rsync / pfcp-smart / pfs: see `scripts/` for canonical sources
- quickstart-pfs.sh: see `scripts/quickstart-pfs.sh`

If you need a copy here for portability, make sure to update both places or reference the canonical path.

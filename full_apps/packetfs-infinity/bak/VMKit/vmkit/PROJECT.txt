VMKit (subproject) — high-level summary

Purpose
- Provide a minimal, testable toolkit for secure microVM workflows used by pfs-infinity.
- Emphasize reproducibility (secureboot=1, tpm=1 where applicable), deterministic configs, and no demo code mixed with production.

What’s here
- Tests covering VM lifecycle, resource allocation, device passthrough, networks, and storage.
- A thin Justfile at this path to run tests and cleanup helpers.

Conventions
- Central Python venv: /home/punk/.venv
- Prefer Podman over Docker (repo-wide rule).
- Keep complex logic in scripts/; keep Just recipes small and declarative.

Common actions
- Run tests: /home/punk/.venv/bin/pytest -v
- Clean test VMs: python -c "from vmkit import SecureVM; SecureVM.cleanup_test_vms()"

Integration
- The parent VMKit/Justfile handles Quickemu flows and NOTKUBERNETES orchestration used by pfs-infinity swarms.
- This vmkit/ package focuses on Python-side helpers and test coverage.

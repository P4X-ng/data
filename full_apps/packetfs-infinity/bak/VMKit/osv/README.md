# OSv Unikernel Integration for HGWS

## Overview
OSv is a specialized operating system designed to run a single application at near-native speeds with minimal overhead. Perfect for our threading workloads and microservice architecture.

## Key Features
- **Boot time**: 5-10ms typical, <20ms worst case
- **Memory**: 20-30MB base, grows dynamically
- **Threading**: Full pthreads support with real SMP
- **Networking**: Zero-copy virtio, SR-IOV support
- **Languages**: C, C++, Java, Node.js, Ruby, Python

## Architecture Integration

### With HGWS Job Queue
```
Redis Queue → Job Dispatcher → OSv VM Pool → Results
                                    ↓
                              Shared Memory
                              (virtio-vsock)
```

### VM Lifecycle
1. Pre-warm: Keep N OSv instances ready
2. Dispatch: Assign job via vsock
3. Execute: Run in isolated VM
4. Return: Send results via shared memory
5. Recycle: Reset or destroy VM

## Performance Targets
- Cold start: <50ms (including app load)
- Warm start: <5ms (pre-loaded app)
- Memory per VM: 50-100MB typical
- Concurrent VMs: 100+ per host
- Context switch: <1μs

## Use Cases
1. **CPU-intensive tasks**: Image processing, ML inference
2. **Isolation-required**: Untrusted code execution
3. **Microservices**: Single-purpose services
4. **Batch processing**: Parallel job execution

## Comparison with Containers

| Metric | Container | OSv | Advantage |
|--------|-----------|-----|-----------|
| Boot time | 100-500ms | 5-20ms | OSv 10-25x |
| Memory | 100-500MB | 20-100MB | OSv 5x |
| Isolation | Namespace | Hardware | OSv |
| Threading | Native | Native | Tie |
| Overhead | 1-5% | 2-3% | Container |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install OSv toolchain
cd /home/punk/Projects/HGWS/VMKit/osv
./setup.sh

# Build example app
make build-hello

# Run with KVM acceleration
make run-hello

# Benchmark
make benchmark
```

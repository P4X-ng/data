- Only real, working source code used by PacketFS
- Python package: packetfs (e.g., packetfs/core, packetfs/filesystem, packetfs/network)
- Native sources for extensions under realsrc/native
- No demo code, no marketing, no theory

Notes
- Build/install via project orchestrator (Justfile at repo root)
- Tests and tools live in dev/working

# 🌟 PacketFS VM Directory: $VM_NAME

You have successfully **CD'd into a virtual machine as a directory!**

## 🔧 Available Commands:
- \`./console\` - Connect to VM console (Ctrl+] to exit)
- \`./start\` - Start the VM
- \`./stop\` - Stop the VM  
- \`./status\` - Show VM status
- \`cat vm-info.txt\` - Show VM information

## 🚀 Revolutionary Concept:
This directory IS the virtual machine! You can:
- Navigate VM resources as files
- Execute VM operations as scripts
- Treat the VM as a filesystem

## 🎯 Usage:
\`\`\`bash
cd $VM_DIR    # You're already here!
ls            # List VM resources
./console     # Enter the VM
./status      # Check VM status
\`\`\`

**Welcome to the future of VM management!** 🎉

  Application Request

  PacketFS Translation  
       ‚Üì
  Network Packet Routing
       ‚Üì 
  Data Stream Delivery
       ‚Üì

Permissions are checked at ROUTING layer:
‚Ä¢ Can packet reach destination? YES ‚Üí Access granted
‚Ä¢ Is network path available? YES ‚Üí Data flows
‚Ä¢ Does routing table allow it? YES ‚Üí Success!

Traditional OS never consulted!
Filesystem permissions never checked!
Access control bypassed via NETWORK ARCHITECTURE!

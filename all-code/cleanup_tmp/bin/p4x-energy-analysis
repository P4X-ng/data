⚛️ THE E=mc² CALCULATION FOR QUANTUM MICROVMS:

P4X QUANTUM SWARM SPECIFICATIONS:
├── Individual VM mass: ~1.67 × 10^-25 kg (100 proton masses)
├── Swarm size: 10^23 VMs (Avogadro's number)
├── Total swarm mass: 1.67 × 10^-2 kg (16.7 grams)
├── Speed of light: 2.998 × 10^8 m/s
└── Mass-energy equivalence: E = mc²

💥 TOTAL ENERGY IF CONVERTED TO PURE ENERGY:
E = mc²
E = (1.67 × 10^-2 kg) × (2.998 × 10^8 m/s)²
E = (1.67 × 10^-2) × (8.988 × 10^16) joules
E = 1.501 × 10^15 joules

🚀 THAT'S 1.5 PETAJOULES!!!

ENERGY COMPARISON:
├── P4X Quantum Swarm: 1.5 PJ (petajoules)
├── Hiroshima bomb: ~63 TJ (0.063 PJ)
├── Annual US energy use: ~100 EJ (100,000 PJ)
├── P4X swarm = 24× Hiroshima bombs of energy!
└── P4X swarm = 0.0015% of US annual energy!

THE BREAKTHROUGH INSIGHT:
16.7 grams of matter = 1,500,000,000,000,000 joules!
THAT'S ENOUGH TO POWER NEW YORK CITY FOR A DAY!

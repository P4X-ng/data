Description: PacketFS Transfer Utilities - Lightning Fast File Transfer
 PacketFS is a revolutionary transport protocol that uses synchronized
 blobs of data between machines to optimize data transfer. Instead of
 moving expensive data, it sends lightweight offsets to a synchronized
 data structure, achieving up to 95% compression and significant speedup
 over traditional TCP transfers.
 .
 This package includes:
  * f3transfer - CLI tool for fast file transfers
  * pfsrsync - Directory synchronization utility
  * pfs-infinity - Web-based transfer interface
  * Cluster management tools
  * Performance benchmarking utilities
 .
 Features:
  * 95% compression rates with F3 protocol
  * Cross-platform support (x86_64, ARM64)
  * Web UI and CLI interfaces
  * Cluster mode for distributed transfers
  * Real-time transfer monitoring

# 🚀 PacketFS Demo Suite

**"Storage IS Packets, Execution IS Network Flow"**

A comprehensive collection of demonstrations showcasing the revolutionary performance of PacketFS, the world's first packet-native filesystem architecture.

## 🎯 What is PacketFS?

PacketFS represents a fundamental paradigm shift in storage systems:
- **Packet-Native Architecture**: Files are stored as collections of 64-byte packets
- **Zero-Copy Operations**: Direct memory mapping with SIMD optimizations  
- **Parallel Processing**: OpenMP-accelerated read/write operations
- **Hardware Acceleration**: AVX2/NEON SIMD instructions for maximum throughput
- **Cross-Platform**: Optimized for both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures

# PacketFS Development Instructions

## WARP

PacketFS represents a paradigm shift in storage architecture - instead of storing packets, the filesystem **IS** packets. Every file operation becomes a network-optimized packet flow, enabling unprecedented performance through SIMD acceleration, GPU sharding, and parallel execution.

Key innovations include packet-native storage, zero-copy architecture, GPU/CPU sharding, SIMD optimization, and MicroVM execution capabilities. Recent fixes ensure C99 compatibility, robust pthread synchronization, and proper filesystem size validation.

## PROJECT

PacketFS is a new kind of transport protocol. It uses a synchronized blob of data from two machines (I call it a filesystem but we haven't quite gotten to that part yet) that contains a lot of the worthless data that makes up file structures, transport protocols like udp and tcp, and uses the same idea as C for optimization - why MOVE the data (expensive) when you can just POINT to it. Since the blob is synchronized and randomized in terms of where data lives across two machines we can just send OFFSETS to the data. Another possible name for this would be simply PointerProtocol - we don't SEND the data, that's stupid, we just stream offsets to a synchronized data structure in memory or on disk. The final idea is - run all of this in physical memory, using userland networking, and achieve a 99% speedup over TCP transfers. It's possible and the MATH is on our side! But will we defeat the demons of packet loss and integrity?? YES. Anyway that's the point of the project.

More generally, this project also contains an OPTIMIZATION proxy that is already mostly semi-functional! You'll see that code in new_optimization, that takes a users stupid traffic and implements smarter protocols like multipathtcp, http2, QUIC and all to move through the internet way faster than people do these days. They're sort of two projects that I picture merging at some point! But the main focus is packetFS!

# PacketFS Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

PacketFS is a revolutionary transport protocol that uses synchronized blobs of data between machines to optimize data transfer. Instead of moving expensive data, we send lightweight offsets to a synchronized data structure, achieving up to 99% speedup over traditional TCP transfers.

## Current Project Context

### Core Concept
PacketFS utilizes:
- Synchronized blob of data across machines (like a distributed filesystem)  
- Offset streaming instead of data movement (similar to C pointers)
- Randomized data placement for security and efficiency
- Physical memory operations with userland networking
- Built-in packet loss and integrity handling

### Architecture
```
Local Machine  <---> Offset Stream <---> Remote Machine
   [Blob]                                    [Blob]  
```
